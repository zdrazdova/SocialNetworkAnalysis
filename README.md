# SocialNetworkAnalysis

Project for Social Network Analysis class - Analysis of Flights of the company US Airways in the US in 1997

We examined (social) network properties and displayed intereting properties of the network on the map. 

In **slides.pdf** are the results

In **analyze.py**is the code generating the slides. 

The project is a little messy. Maybe it will be tidied up eventually.
